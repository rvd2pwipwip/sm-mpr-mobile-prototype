# Stingray Music (MPR) mobile prototype — implementation plan

This file is the **running plan**: what we intend to do, what we have done, and what is next. Use it to **onboard after a break** and to keep scope visible without digging through chat history.

**See also:** `docs/Home-screen-story.md` (product story for Home), `docs/figma-nodes.md` (Figma links), `src/data/*` (mock catalogs).

---

## Goals (prototype)

- **Clickable** mobile-first UX: music, podcasts, radio.
- **Fake data only**; no real APIs.
- **Figma** as layout reference; match structure and hierarchy, not pixel perfection by default.
- **User types** (guest, provided, subscribed) reflected in **header, ads, and footer height** (stubs are OK).

---

## What we have done

- [x] Vite + React project scaffold.
- [x] Cursor project rules: `.cursor/rules/stingray-music-prototype.mdc` (swimlanes, bottom nav, tokens, fake data).
- [x] `docs/figma-nodes.md` — design file and screen node links.
- [x] `docs/Home-screen-story.md` — Home narrative (header, banner, swimlanes, footer, ads, user types).
- [x] `docs/plan.md` — this living plan (update as we ship scope).
- [x] Mock data modules:
  - [x] `src/data/musicChannels.js` — `MusicChannel`, `MUSIC_GENRES`, related channels for info screen.
  - [x] `src/data/podcasts.js` — `Podcast`, episodes, `PODCAST_CATEGORIES`.
  - [x] `src/data/radioStations.js` — `RadioStation`, `RADIO_STATION_CATEGORIES`, international nesting noted as follow-up in file + figma map.
- [x] `docs/react-learning.md` — started; append entries as we implement (swimlanes, Router, BottomNav, …).
- [ ] `App.jsx` / routing / shell / Home UI — not implemented yet (placeholder only).

## Home screen — implementation approach

**Recommended order** (aligns with component-first UX work):

1. **Card components (three content types)**  
   Music channel, podcast show, radio station — default tile; plan for a **small / no-label** variant later (Listen again).

2. **Swimlane / row**  
   Inset **title + “More”**, full-bleed **horizontal scroll** with inner `padding-inline: var(--space-content-inline)` (see project rules; karaoke `SongSwimlane` is the pattern reference in the sibling prototype).

3. **Home page (first vertical slice)**  
   `main.app-shell` → `div.home-screen` with `div.content-inset` (light placeholders if needed) + **swimlane `section`s as siblings** — e.g. one lane each for music, podcasts, and radio from `src/data`.

4. **Chrome after core content**  
   `BottomNav`, `Home` header (branding, Upgrade / provider), banner, `padding-bottom` for nav + safe area. Then Listen again, Favorites, Recommendations, ads, mini player — with mock state where needed.

5. **User mode stub**  
   Context or simple state: guest | provided | subscribed — drives header CTA, ad visibility, and footer content height per `Home-screen-story.md`.

## Next steps (near term)

- [ ] Add `react-router-dom`, `BrowserRouter`, routes for main tabs and stacked flows (per Figma when confirmed).
- [ ] Flesh out `src/index.css`: tokens (`--space-content-inline`, `--space-screen-gap`, phone frame max-width 460px), `app-shell`, theme base.
- [ ] **Cards** (music / podcast / radio) + **swimlane** component + **Home** with three data-backed lanes.
- [ ] Append to `docs/react-learning.md` when introducing swimlane or NavLink work here (append-only, short entries).

---

## Backlog / later

- [ ] **Listen again** — mixed small tiles; `recentlyPlayed` mock.
- [ ] **Favorites** — liked content rail (sparse by design).
- [ ] **Recommendations** — generic stub, then “informed by” fake history.
- [ ] Detail screens: music channel info, podcast info, station info; then players + mini player.
- [ ] **International radio** hierarchy — `radioStations.js` + `docs/figma-nodes.md` notes.
- [ ] **Territory** variants (150+ vs 1000+ channels) for browse, when building Search & Browse.

## How to maintain this file

- After **meaningful** work (a feature, a milestone, or a clear scope change): update **What we have done** and **Next steps**; adjust **Backlog** as needed.
- **Do not** log every tiny fix — focus on what future-you needs to remember.
- This file does **not** replace `Home-screen-story.md` (product) or `figma-nodes.md` (design index); it **ties implementation to them**.
